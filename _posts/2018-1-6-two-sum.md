## Problem
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Solution
Complexity Analysis:

+ Time complexity : `O(n)`. We traverse the list containing `n` elements only once. Each look up in the table costs only `O(1)` time.

+ Space complexity : `O(n)`. The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table, which stores at most `n` elements.
